# Emergency-services
This project was developed by me for a school project created for Rashtriya Bal Vaigyanik Pradarshani (RVBP). It works on sending messages to the traffic light system to clear the way for emergency services stuck due to traffic congestion. I coded it using HTML and JavaScript, then converted it into a web app and further into an APK. Unfortunately, due to school project submission constraints, I am unable to provide the source code.This project has truly inspired me to continue following my passion and strive to make the world a better place.

This is a brief excerpt from our project video, created with the assistance of my friend.

Please note that the messaging system in the app has been disabled due to school project purposes.
